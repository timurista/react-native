Using expo and react native to build out sample projects.

## TODO

## Animations with React native

Layout animation vs Animated System

Layout animation

- change size of box or circle, good solution. Easy to setup.

- lacks fine-grained control :(

- want ball to move vertically or in 1 dimension, layout animation.

## Animated

If you want a thing to respond to user input. Much more complicated but far more power with it. Reach for animated.

## Ball movement

down from top to bottom, smooth motion
3 questions for animation

1. Where is item right now? Exact x,y
2. where is element moving to
3. which elemnt are we moving?

How is animation changing? spring, decay, timing
components, view text image
